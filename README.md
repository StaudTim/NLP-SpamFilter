# Natural language processing - Spam filter

This project was a proof of achievement as part of my studies in artificial intelligence. We should implement a spam
filter based on Naive Bayes without using any library.

## Task

Implement a spam filter that is based on naive Bayes:

- Create your own data set of messages, extract messages from your email box or find a data set online
- Implement naive Bayes, do not use a library such as scikit-learn
- Report accuracy, precision, recall and F1 on the test set

In addition to the implementation, you have to write a report that consists of the following parts:

- Introduction: e.g. goals of your project, why your problem is important to be solved, related work, etc.
- Methodology: describe the mathematical and conceptual foundations of your model
- Experimental results and discussion: e.g. some details on your data set, report metrics (accuracy, precision, recall,
  F1) of your model, discuss strengths and limitations of your model, report other interesting findings, etc. (Do not
  include any code. However, you can discuss in a few sentences some practical implementation issues you encountered)
- Conclusions and prospects: summary and what else you could do in order to further improve your model

## Install

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
